# 42_ft_linear_regression
### An introduction to machine learning.
 
## Description
This project is an introduction to the linear regression algorithm. The goal is to predict the price of a car based on its mileage. 
The program uses the gradient descent algorithm to find the best fit line for the data.

## Mandatory part
- Create a program that predicts the price of a car based on its mileage.
- Create a program that trains the model to find the best fit line for the data.

## Bonus part
- Plotting the data into a graph.
- Plotting the line into the same graph.
- A program that calculates the precision of the model.
